<h2>About Mathtoys</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Mathtoys is an online tool for helping you solve algebra problems step
by step.  You decide what step to do next, and it takes care of
the details.
<p>
Mathtoys proves everything it does starting from basic laws of numbers
and reasoning.  This means you cannot do an incorrect step.  You may
not get a solution, or perhaps not exactly the solution you were
looking for, but each step and each result will be mathematically
correct.
<p>
Mathtoys does its reasoning using the Prooftoys proof assistant,
slightly extended for math education.  Both Prooftoys and Mathtoys are
open source software, which means they are available for anyone to
use, learn from, or improve, with complete access to the source code.
For more information about all of this check out the
<a href="http://prooftoys.org/">Prooftoys</a> web site.

<h3>Doing algebra with Mathtoys</h3>
<p>
So far Mathtoys has learned definitions and useful steps for solving
equations and simplifying expressions in basic algebra.  It comes with
a few predefined problems, or you can enter your own.  Click on a step
in your problem or any expression to see options using your selection
in the next step.  You can remove steps you don't like at any time,
and try again.
